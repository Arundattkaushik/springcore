========================// Spring Core
IoC:- It is a pre-defined program.
It is responsible for creating objects 
Injecting objects 
Holding objects in the memory.
That means it is responsible for maintaining the complete life cycle of an object.

//== Notes on bean configuration in xml file
******** For getter and setter injection **********
There are three ways we can declare a bean in xml
1. first way
<bean class="fully qualified name of java class" name="name of class object">
//Under property tag we have to define class properties
	<property name="studentId">
		<value>101</value>
	</property>
</bean>

2. second way:- in this way we remove value tag and declare values inside property tag
Example:-

	<bean class="com.spring.core.Student" name="student1">
		<property name="studentId" value="102" />

		<property name="studentName" value="Vrun" />

		<property name="studentAddress" value="Lucknow" />

	</bean>

3. third way:- in this way we remove even the property tag and declare all the class properties and values 
inside the bean tag. This can be acheived only with the help of 'p' schema of spring.
Exmaple:-
<!-- This is our bean configuration for setter injection using 'p' schema  -->
	<bean class="com.spring.core.Student" name="student"
	 p:studentId="101" 
	 p:studentName="Arun"
	 p:studentAddress="Noida"
	 />
